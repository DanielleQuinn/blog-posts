**How were data collected?**

I informally collected information during the question period of talks presented at the American Fisheries Society Meeting in 
Atlantic City, New Jersey between August 20 – 24. In each instance, I recorded the number of males and females in the 
audience (excluding myself and the moderator), the gender of the presenter, the gender of the person asking each question, 
and the duration of the question using Cathy Deng’s online tool [“Who’s Talking?”](http://arementalkingtoomuch.com/). 
Quoting a 2017 study by [<sup>1</sup>](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185534)Hinsley et al., 
“*…these methods treat gender as a binary dichotomy, which is not the case. In addition, the visual identification of gender assumes that
people identify as the gender they appear. This will not always be true…*” I apologize for the exclusion and acknowledge the limitations – 
I hope that others will share ideas about how to make this kind of informal observational study more inclusive.

**What data were collected?**

- A total of 79 questions were asked at 26 talks and the data and code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/DanielleQuinn/blog-posts/upload/gh-pages/afs148).

- Of a total 864 audience members, 343 (39.7 %) were women, with women representing an average of 39.1 % of the audience in each talk.

**Is there is a difference in the number of questions asked by men and women?**

- Of a total 79 questions, 17 questions (21.5 %) were asked by women, with women asking an average of 19.4 % of the questions in
each talk. This translates to men asking 3.6 questions for every one question asked by women.

- In 69.2 % of talks, women asked no questions. In these instances, men asked one to five questions per talk.

- Comparing across talks, men asked significantly more (2.38 +/- 1.44) questions than women (0.65 +/- 1.16) (Wilcoxon test,
p < 0.01).

**Is there a difference in the duration of questions asked by men and women?**

- Of a total of 934 seconds of questions, 208 seconds (22.3 %) were asked by women.

- Comparing across questions, there was no significant difference in the duration of questions asked by men (11.7 +/- 7.73 seconds) 
and women (12.2 +/- 6.61 seconds) (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.616).

**Does it matter who asks the first question?**

- Women asked the first question in five (19.2 %) talks while men asked the first question in 21 (80.7 %) talks. 

- 100 % of the talks where women asked the first question had women asking proportionally as many or more questions as men;
this was the case in only 9.5 % of talks where men asked the first question.

**Final Thoughts**

This is far from a perfectly scientific study; I’m sure that we can all think of confounding factors! For example, I collected this 
data while attending talks that I was specifically interested in, including anything related to data science, sharks, and community 
outreach. Maybe attending topics from other domains (genomics, physiology, etc.) would have had completely different results! While 
I never intended for this to become anything more than an interesting conversation piece, I would like to challenge women to 
continue asking questions at conferences and I think that this is a hobby / side project that I’m going to continue doing in the 
future. If you have any thoughts about who is dominating conversations in your environment, I would highly recommend trying out the 
“Who’s Talking?” app!
