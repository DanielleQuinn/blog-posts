## 5 Worthwhile Tangents in Graduate School
If you're a graduate student, you already know that time management is a perpetual challenge and often-discussed topic at all levels of graduate school.  

You'll be committed (and often encouraged) to focus solely on your own experiments / research / thesis / classwork, and to steer away from the temptation of the many distractions that present themselves along the way. For the most part, that frame of mind will help you complete your work, submit your thesis in a timely fashion, and reduce the stress that you (and your supervisor) experience along the way.  

But what you might not realize is that some of these distractions are actually valuable opportunities in disguise. At the end of the day, graduate school is about more than "just" your thesis. As my supervisor once told me, the extra letters at the end of your signature (MSc, PhD) aren't going to get you hired by themselves. As a graduate student, it's important to recognize tangents that are worth making the time for!  

First, a disclaimer: I finished my MSc in 2013 and, in large part because of the points listed below, took an extra six months to submit my thesis. Currently, I'm three years into my PhD, slowly progressing along what I call the "extended track". So *do* keep in mind that balancing (even worthwhile) tangents with thesis progress is important and it's up to you and your supervisor to examine what level of flexibility your program has and decide how you can optimize it.  

### 1. Acquire Transferable Skills  

There is *huge* demand for data science skills, including data management, programming, statistical analyses, machine learning, and app development. Graduate students are typically exposed to at least foundational computing or statistical techniques through their research or the research of their peers. *Take advantage of this opportunity to develop your skills!* Ask professionals / supervisors / faculty / senior students / peers what tools and methodologies they are using. Attend workshops. Try new techniques and practice what you've learned. Don't treat your analyses as "one and done"; instead, take the time to understand, develop, and document your skill set. These skills will be critical assets when the time comes for you to apply for higher level positions.  

If you're unsure about what specific skill sets you should be focusing on, I recommend that you browse current job openings, take note of what skill sets consistently appear, and then talk to your supervisor and others around you to learn more about what local expertise and support will be available during your learning process.  

### 2. Attend Conferences (and Present Your Work!) 

The idea of standing in front of a room full of subject experts and discussing your research can be daunting or downright terrifying. But attending conferences and presenting your work can be incredibly productive. First, provides an opportunity to practice your public speaking; the importance of being able to effectively communicate your work can’t be stressed enough. In addition, conferences provide a unique environment for knowledge sharing and force you to gain new perspectives and insight into your work and how it might fit into the “big picture”. I always come back from conferences *exhausted* but inspired to dive back into my work and frame my research goals in new and interesting ways.

Quite often, the most valuable takeaway of a conference is the opportunity for networking. Take advantage of both formalized networking events, like poster sessions and dinners, and impromptu meetups for coffee or beer. I was invited to South Africa to teach a series of workshops after chatting with a new acquaintance at a conference dinner and spent a week in North Carolina assembling an incredible data set to supplement my thesis after approaching a fellow researcher following his presentation. A close friend from graduate school found himself on an Antarctic expedition because he had discussed his research goals with fellow conference-goers at a networking event, who subsequently contacted him after a team member needed to drop out. You never know what connections can be established, what doors these connections might open, or what you will be able to contribute.

### 3. Pursue Consulting Opportunities

### 4. Lecture, Teach, Instruct, Supervise, and Otherwise Interact with Students  

< FINISH > Teaching is a chance to give back, to connect with professors on a different level, 
to connect with undergraduates, to learn the material in a more in-depth way. < FINISH >

Perhaps most importantly, these experiences will help you frame future decisions and define a path forward. If you are planning on continuing in academia, you'll be better prepared by knowing what style of teaching suits you best and help you develop your teaching skills and personal pedagogical philosophies. Or, you might realize that teaching isn't something you want to take on as a regular component of your career! Here, having early exposure gives you time to consider alternatives in industry or government or to explore how to approach teaching in a way that works for you.  

### 5. Become a Part of Something Larger  

< FINISH > Graduate school doesn't (and shouldn't!) operate in a vacuum.  

### Take Home Message  

I can confidently say that these experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded scientist and allowed me to pursue a number of incredible opportunities, including teaching, travelling, and consulting with organizations globally. While it's true that these (and other) tangents take time, they will boost your resume, making you more competitive on funding and job applications, and give you the opportunity to really figure out what aspect(s) of research make you tick. As an added bonus, these tangents can provide refreshing, fulfilling breaks to the tediousness and frustration that often comes with writing a thesis - just make sure you allocate your time carefully!
