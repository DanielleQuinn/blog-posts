## 5 Worthwhile Tangents in Graduate School

If you're a graduate student, you already know that time management is a perpetual 
challenge and often-discussed topic at all levels of graduate school.  

You'll be committed (and often encouraged) to focus solely on your own 
experiments / research / thesis / classwork, and to steer away from the 
temptation of the many distractions that present themselves along
the way. For the most part, that frame of mind will help you complete your 
work, submit your thesis in a timely fashion, and reduce the stress that you 
(and your supervisor) experience along the way.  

But, what you might not realize is that some of these distractions are actually 
valuable opportunities in disguise. At the end of the day, graduate school is about more 
than "just" your thesis. As my supervisor once told me, the extra letters at the end of your signiature 
(MSc, PhD) aren't going to get you hired by themselves; as a graduate student, it's 
important to recognize tangents that are worth making the time for!

First, a disclaimer: I finished my MSc in 2013 and, in large part 
because of the points listed below, took an extra six months to submit my thesis. 
At the moment, I'm three years into my PhD, slowly progressing along what I call the 
"extended track". So *do* keep in mind that balancing (even worthwhile) tangents with 
thesis progress is important and it's up to you and your supervisor to examine what 
level of flexibility your program has and decide how you can optimize it.    

### 1. Acquire Transferable Skills  

There is *huge* demand for data science skills, including data management, programming, statistical analyses, machine learning, and app development. Graduate 
students are typically exposed to at least foundational computing or statistical 
techniques through their research or the research of their peers. *Take advantage of this opportunity to develop your skills!* Attend workshops. Ask professionals / supervisors / faculty / senior students / peers what tools and methodologies they 
are using. Attend workshops. Try new techniques and practice what you've learned. Don't treat your analyses are "one and done"; instead, take the time to understand 
and document your skill set. These skills will be critical assets when the time comes 
for you to apply for higher level positions.  

If you're unsure about what specific skill sets you should be focusing on, I recommend that you browse current job openings, take note of what skill sets consistently appear, and then talk to your supervisor and others around you to learn more about what local expertise and support will be available during your learning process.  

### 2. Attend Conferences (and Present Your Work!) 

### 3. Pursue Consulting Opportunities  

### 4. Lecture, Teach, Instruct, Supervise, and Otherwise Interact with Students  

< FINISH > Teaching is a chance to give back, to connect with professors on a different level, 
to connect with undergraduates, to learn the material in a more in depth way. < FINISH >

Perhaps most importantly, these experiences will help you frame future decisions and 
define a path forward. If you are planning on continuing in academia, you'll be better 
prepared by knowing what style of teaching suits you best and help you develop your 
teaching skills and personal pedagogical philsophies. Or, you might realize that teaching 
isn't something you want to take on as a regular component of your career and give you 
time to consider alternatives in industry or government.  

### 5. Become a Part of Something Larger  

Graduate school doesn't (and shouldn't!) operate in a vacuum. 

### Take Home Message  

I can confidently say that these experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded 
scientist and allowed me to pursue a number of incredible opportunities, including 
teaching, travelling, and consulting with organizations globally. While it's true 
that these (and other) tangents take time, they will boost your resume, making you 
more competitive on funding and job applications, and give you the opportunity 
to really figure out what aspect(s) of research make you tick. As an added bonus, 
these tangents can provide refreshing, fulfilling breaks to the tediousness and 
frustration that often comes with writing a thesis - just make sure you 
allocate your time carefully!
