In every coding workshop I teach, there are two things I tell my learners: (a) celebrate every victory; it makes the inevitable 
error messages easier to handle, and (b) learn (and practice) new programming concepts by doing things that "don't matter".

The last workshop I taught was at the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago, as part of a Carpentries workshop on July 31 - August 1, where I
covered introductory R and RStudio topics, as well as the key concepts of {dplyr}, {gplot2}, and {knitr}. Near the end of the lesson, I 
asked the learners (who had varying levels of previous experience coding) "How many of you have ever coded just for the fun of it?" 
Needless to say, I saw some confused faces and more than a few smirks. As the audience glanced at each other and shook their heads,
I delievered my standard advice: "practice what you've learned today by doing things that don't matter."

Stumbling through newly learned coding skills while also attempting to reach your research goals (check out 
[cognitive load](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02504793)) is a recipe for frustration, confusion, and the feeling of 
crushing defeat. My advice (which I regularly use myself!) is to instead give yourself a task that will require you to hone your
computational skills without the added pressure of needing to be correct or quick.




Is it foolproof? Definitely not; I think it's reasonably tough from a statistical point of view, but shifting the substitution key up and 
down the alphabet isn't likely to fool a human brain for all that long. My code could undoubtedly be made "prettier", more efficient, and
______. But, this exercise is how I finally wrapped my head around what indexing is really all about.
